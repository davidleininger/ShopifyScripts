# ShopifyScript
Life Teen uses these scripts to apply discounts to products and to allow payment gateways specific items ordered on our Shopify Plus store.

## Bulk and Individual
This script allows us to set bulk discount to products based on the quantity. The discounts are based on an actual dollar amount not precentage.

## Payment Gateway
Here we check to see if there is a specific tag on an item. If that item is in the cart, offer a new payment gateway.
